NOTE 1: References to business in this International Standard should be interpreted broadly to mean those activities that are core to the purposes for the organizations existence.
Controls objectives and controls shall be selected and implemented to meet the requirements identified by the risk assessment and risk treatment process. This selection shall take account of the criteria for accepting risks (see 4.2.1c)) as well as legal, regulatory and contractual requirements.
The control objectives and controls from Annex A shall be selected as part of this process as suitable to cover these requirements.
A Statement of Applicability shall be prepared that includes the following:
Documents required by the ISMS shall be protected and controlled. A documented procedure shall be established to define the management actions needed to:
a) approve documents for adequacy prior to issue;
b) review and update documents as necessary and re-approve documents;
c) ensure that changes and the current revision status of documents are identified;
d) ensure that relevant versions of applicable documents are available at points of use;
e) ensure that documents remain legible and readily identifiable;
f) ensure that documents are available to those who need them, and are transferred, stored and ultimately disposed of in accordance with the procedures applicable to their classification;
g) ensure that documents of external origin are identified;
h) ensure that the distribution of documents is controlled;
i) prevent the unintended use of obsolete documents; and
j) apply suitable identification to them if they are retained for any purpose.
Records shall be established and maintained to provide evidence of conformity to requirements and the effective operation of the ISMS. They shall be protected and controlled.

a) results of ISMS audits and reviews;
b) feedback from interested parties;
c) techniques, products or procedures, which could be used in the organization to improve the ISMS performance and effectiveness;
d) status of preventive and corrective actions;
e) vulnerabilities or threats not adequately addressed in the previous risk assessment;

g) follow-up actions from previous management reviews;
h) any changes that could affect the ISMS; and
i) recommendations for improvement.
The organization shall determine action to eliminate the cause of potential nonconformities with the ISMS requirements in order to prevent their occurrence. Preventive actions taken shall be appropriate to the impact of the potential problems. The documented procedure for preventive action shall define requirements for:

b) evaluating the need for action to prevent occurrence of nonconformities;
c) determining and implementing preventive action needed;
d) recording results of action taken (see 4.3.3); and
e) reviewing of preventive action taken.
The priority of preventive actions shall be determined based on the results of the risk assessment.
