This International Standard covers all types of organizations (e.g. commercial enterprises, government agencies, not-for profit organizations). This International Standard specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving a documented ISMS within the context of the organizations overall business risks. It specifies requirements for the implementation of security controls customized to the needs of individual organizations or parts thereof.
3.16 statement of applicability documented statement describing the control objectives and controls that are relevant and applicable to the organizations ISMS.

Records shall be established and maintained to provide evidence of conformity to requirements and the effective operation of the ISMS. They shall be protected and controlled. The ISMS shall take account of any relevant legal or regulatory requirements and contractual obligations. Records shall remain legible, readily identifiable and retrievable. The controls needed for the identification, storage, protection, retrieval, retention time and disposition of records shall be documented and implemented.
The responsibilities and requirements for planning and conducting audits, and for reporting results and maintaining records (see 4.3.3) shall be defined in a documented procedure.
Management shall review the organizations ISMS at planned intervals (at least once a year) to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness. This review shall include assessing opportunities for improvement and the need for changes to the ISMS, including the information security policy and information security objectives. The results of the reviews shall be clearly documented and records shall be maintained
a) results of ISMS audits and reviews;
b) feedback from interested parties;
c) techniques, products or procedures, which could be used in the organization to improve the ISMS performance and effectiveness;
d) status of preventive and corrective actions;
e) vulnerabilities or threats not adequately addressed in the previous risk assessment;
f) results from effectiveness measurements;
g) follow-up actions from previous management reviews;
h) any changes that could affect the ISMS; and
i) recommendations for improvement.
The input to a management review shall include: a) results of ISMS audits and reviews; b) feedback from interested parties; c) techniques, products or procedures, which could be used in the organization to improve the ISMS performance and effectiveness; d) status of preventive and corrective actions; e) vulnerabilities or threats not adequately addressed in the previous risk assessment; f) results from effectiveness measurements; g) follow-up actions from previous management reviews; h) any changes that could affect the ISMS; and i) recommendations for improvement. 7.3 Review output The output from the management review shall include any decisions and actions related to the following.
a) Improvement of the effectiveness of the ISMS.
b) Update of the risk assessment and risk treatment plan.
c) Modification of procedures and controls that effect information security, as necessary, to respond to internal or external events that may impact on the ISMS, including changes to:
d) Resource needs.
e) Improvement to how the effectiveness of controls is being measured.
The organization shall take action to eliminate the cause of nonconformities with the ISMS requirements in order to prevent recurrence. The documented procedure for corrective action shall define requirements for:
a) identifying nonconformities;
b) determining the causes of nonconformities;
c) evaluating the need for actions to ensure that nonconformities do not recur;
d) determining and implementing the corrective action needed;
e) recording results of action taken (see 4.3.3); and
f) reviewing of corrective action taken.
The organization shall determine action to eliminate the cause of potential nonconformities with the ISMS requirements in order to prevent their occurrence. Preventive actions taken shall be appropriate to the impact of the potential problems. The documented procedure for preventive action shall define requirements for:
a) identifying potential nonconformities and their causes;
b) evaluating the need for action to prevent occurrence of nonconformities;
c) determining and implementing preventive action needed;
d) recording results of action taken (see 4.3.3); and
e) reviewing of preventive action taken.
Rules for the acceptable use of information and assets associated with information processing facilities shall be identified, documented, and implemented.
